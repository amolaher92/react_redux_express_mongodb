# react_redux_express_mongodb
A full-stack web application built with React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB. This project showcases a typical modern web app architecture where the front-end interacts with a back-end API to fetch and store data. The app demonstrates how to manage global state using Redux and persist data using MongoDB through a RESTful API built with Express.
